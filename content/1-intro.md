 - Implement advanced regression techniques such as and generalized linear models (eg. logistic regression)
 - Manipulate “messy” data into a “tidy” form
 - Other topics such as survival analysis and hierarchical models may be covered depending on student interest

### Homework Guidelines
 - Assignments should be submitted on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.uthsc.edu/ultra/institution-page).
 - All assignments will be graded and carry equal weight.
 - Feel free to work with other students. If you worked with other students, the co-operation should be cited (e.g. “Jane Doe helped me debug the code for producing the scatter plot.”).
 - You are encouraged to meet me in my office hours for help on the homework problems after you have tried to solve the problems on your own. We can meet over zoom or in my office. You can find my zoom link on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.uthsc.edu/ultra/institution-page).
 - For any late homework, you will get the half points of your actual grade for that homework.
